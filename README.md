# Leaf Blower

 A Lua-based mod for the game **Teardown** by Tuxedo Studios.
 
 "Handheld leaf blower to rapidly clear away small debris."
 
 The code and sound effects for the blower are primarily based off of the [Leaf blower](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2399638687) official mod by Tuxedo Studios.
 The code in `options.lua` is based on the [Hook Shotgun](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2412621869) mod by My Cresta.
 The mod can be found on the Teardown Steam Workshop at the following [link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2414946463).
